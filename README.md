# react-app-with-cdn
A simple react app built without **CRA ( create-react-app )**, it simply leverages on library CDN's namely; React, React-Dom and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/setup#installation)

**With a few lines of code and no build tooling**, try React in a small part of your website. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets

Now you can use JSX in any `<script>` tag by adding `type="text/babel"` attribute to it.

## React CDN's
Links to these CDN's are available on the react official website: [https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html) or via [https://unpkg.com/](https://unpkg.com/)
